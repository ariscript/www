# About

I'm Ari Prakash (she/her), a second-year student at
[Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu), where I'm studying Computer
Science and minoring in Mathematics. I'm interested in many things, but mainly
programming languages, type theory, and compilers. I'm also interested in
cybersecurity and low-level programming.

I believe that technology should be used to benefit and empower people and
communities equitably, which is not at all a guarantee with any technological
progress. The systems that we create ought to make the world a better place
rather than deliver value to a select few.

I'm currently open to be hired for internships or co-ops! The public version of
my résumé can be found right [on my website](/resume)! If you're an employer and
want the real deal, please reach out to me per the instructions below.

## Contact

For informal purposes, please reach out to me on one of my socials linked in the
footer. If you must email me, please do so at `ari` at this domain. For anything
important, I would recommend encrypting your email using PGP, with my
[key](/pgp.asc). This key also works for my `.edu` email, so if that address is
more relevant for your inquiry, feel free to use it (if you can find it).
