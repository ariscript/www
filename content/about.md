# About

I'm Ari Prakash
(<a class="trans" href="https://en.pronouns.page/@ariscript" data-external-link="true" target="_blank"><span class="trans">she/her</span></a>),
a second-year student at [Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu),
where I'm studying Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I'm interested
in using the language of mathematics and logic to reason about programs, and to
this end, learning about compilers and programming language theory. I'm also
interested in cybersecurity and low-level systems programming.

I believe that technology should be used to benefit and empower people and
communities equitably, which is not at all a guarantee with any technological
progress. The systems that we create ought to make the world a better place
rather than deliver value to a select few.
