# About

I'm Ari Prakash ([she/her](https://en.pronouns.page/@ariscript)), a second-year
student at [Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu), where I'm
studying Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I'm interested in using
the language of mathematics and logic to reason about programs, and to this end,
learning about compilers and programming language theory. I'm also interested in
cybersecurity and low-level systems programming.

I believe that technology should be used to benefit and empower people and
communities equitably, which is not at all a guarantee with any technological
progress. The systems that we create ought to make the world a better place
rather than deliver value to a select few.

## Contact

For informal purposes, please reach out to me on one of my socials linked in the
footer. If you must email me, please do so at `ari` at this domain. For anything
important, I recommend encrypting your email using PGP, with my [key](/pgp.asc).
This key also works for my `.edu` email, so if that address is more relevant for
your inquiry, feel free to use it.

I'm also very available on Discord. If you know my Discord account, feel free to
shoot me a message there. I'm not going to put my username here, but you can get
it from me through other means.
