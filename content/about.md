<h1>About</h1>

I am a 19-year-old trans woman, and a student at
[Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu), where I'm studying Computer
Science.

I'm interested in a lot of things, but chiefly programming language theory,
compilers, and low level development - I'm looking to pursue many of these
topics through education. I'll probably be writing about what I learn in these
areas over time.

I believe that computing techonolgy can and should be used for more good than
what we're currently seeing, especially in the AI space. We should aim for more
responsible and equitable development of these systems, in a way that benefits
all. Technology comes with huge potential to benefit humanity, but must be
wielded with the right priorities in mind (which is unfortunately not all that
common).

I'm a firm believer in
[Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), as users should
ultimately have control over what code is being run on their computers, and the
freedom to see how the programs they use work. I strive to make all my publicly
available code free to use.
