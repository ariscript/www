# About

I'm Ari Prakash (ஆரி பிரகாஷ்)
(<a href="https://en.pronouns.page/@ariscript" data-external-link="true" target="_blank"><span class="pride trans">she/her</span></a>,
அவள்), a third-year student at
[Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu), where I'm studying Computer
Science and minoring in Mathematics.

I'm interested in making it easier for developers to write safe and correct
software, with the hope that such software can make it easier to empower
marginalized people.
