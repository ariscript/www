# About

I'm Ari Prakash (she/her), a second-year student at
[Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu), where I'm studying Computer
Science and minoring in Mathematics.

I'm interested in many things, but chiefly programming language theory,
compilers, and low level development - I'm looking to pursue many of these
topics through education. I'll probably be writing about what I learn in these
areas over time.

I believe that computing techonolgy can and should be used for more good than
what we're currently seeing, especially in the AI space. We should aim for more
responsible and equitable development of these systems, in a way that benefits
all. Technology comes with huge potential to benefit humanity, but must be used
with all of its impacts considered (which is unfortunately not all that common).

I'm a firm believer in
[Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), as users should
ultimately have control over what code is being run on their computers, and the
freedom to see how the programs they use work. I strive to make all my publicly
available code free to use.

I'm currently open to be hired for internships or co-ops! The public version of
my resum√© can be found right [on my website](/resume)! Remember that it's
designed for PDF export and not to be looked at in a browser. If you're an
employer and want to see the real deal, please contact me privately.

## Contact

For informal things, please reach out to me on one of my socials linked at the
bottom of this page (and most other pages). If you must email me, email me at
`ari` at this domain. For anything of even mild importance, I would recommend
encrypting your email using GPG, with my [key](/pgp.asc). If you have another
email for me (perhaps at a different domain) that would be more relevant, please
feel free to use it.
