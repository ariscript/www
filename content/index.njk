    <p>👋🏽 Welcome!</p>
    <p>
        This is the place where I write things, and the place where you should
        read them. I write about whatever I want: which mostly seems to be
        about logic, technology, politics, and how they intersect.
    </p>
    <p>This is my <strong>personal</strong> page. Opinions here are my own.</p>
