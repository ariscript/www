I removed this article for the time being since I didn't really love the way
this was written, and am replacing it with this page just to keep the URL alive.
If you are interested in seeing what it once was, there exists a machine that
might show you the way this page was back when it had that content. The short
version is that I took a class on this topic that I did not enjoy very much and
that really makes itself clear in the article, even though it's not the point.
Almost all of what it said was _true_, but it wasn't written as well as it ought
to be.

One day, when I have time, and I can better articulate my thoughts about this
book, I will rewrite it in a way that I'm proud of.
