# What Comes Next?

We lost.

We tried, but we lost tremendously. I can't tell you not to be scared, because I
am too. I also don't want to point fingers around to blame someone for this
outcome, since very much of it was not in our control. What I do want to talk
about is how we take this news and continue, as much as it sucks.

He will start doing the things he says he will, and we shouldn't be surprised
when this inevitably happens. He will strip away the rights of the most
vulnerable, scapegoat us for systemic issues in the United States, and try to
erase us as much as possible.

## We must fight.

Not because it's fun, but because we _have to_. They have a trifecta, or at
least close to it (at time of writing, we don't know how the house is going, but
it seems to be going), and the have the Supreme Court. Without opposing
insttitutions to check his power, we have nothing stopping him from... anything.

But we cannot give up now, we cannot let him abandon our partners overseas, drag
us into further tensions with othercountries, or cozy up to authoritarian
regimes. And we cannot let him strip away our bodily autonomy and our rights
piece by piece. We have no choice but to resist their advance at every turn and
fight for ourselves and the people we care about.

There is still hope, these four years are likely to be bleak, but we once again
get another chance to change things. We have to build our power by next time,
but until then we have to protect ourselves and try to reduce the damage that's
being done. Even this is not certain, but in tough times all we can have is
hope, and the resolve to continue to fight another day.
