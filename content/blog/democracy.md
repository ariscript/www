# On Democracy

I should be writing a paper for my my classes right now, yet I'm here instead
writing about the perilous future of the democracy of the United States (at
least the imperfect form that it currently exists in).

In this upcoming election, we have two candidates - and some other people. One
candidate suggests that he would use the Department of Justice to indict his
political rivals:

> I mean, if somebody — if I happen to be president and I see somebody who's
> doing well and beating me very badly, I say, 'Go down and indict them.' Mostly
> what that would be, you know, they would be out of business. They'd be out,
> they'd be out of the election.
>
> --

One candidate said that he is above the law, and that it didn't matter to his
voters:

> I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't
> lose any voters, OK?

One candidate explicitly called back to language used by Hitler and Mussolini:

> [I will] root out the communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical left thugs
> that live like vermin within the confines of our country that lie and steal and
> cheat on elections.

He also
[said](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cnn-donald-trump-hitler-interest_n_6581649ae4b036ecab467876)
that "Hitler did a lot of good things", and "criticized U.S. generals for not
acting like Hitler’s generals".

One candidate wanted to be a dictator for a day (dictator for "one day" is not a
valid defense):

> I said I want to be a dictator for one day. You know why I wanted to be a
> dictator? Because I want a wall, and I want to drill, drill, drill,

One candidate wants to defund transgender healthcare and prevent education in
schools:

> [I would] cut federal funding [for schools teaching] critical race theory, transgender
> insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.
> ...
>
> [I would block actions to] promote promote the concept of sex and gender
> transition at any age.

One candidate said there would be no need to vote anymore:

> We’ll have it fixed so good you’re not going to have to vote.

## So Much for One candidate, Where's the Other?

Granted, I don't entirely agree with everything the other candidate wants to do
(nor does anyone, really). Specifically, her stance on the conflict in Palestine
remains unclear, and she remains open to further aiding Israel in this conflict.
This is not to say the former candidate would be better for Gaza, far from it -
but neither candidate is particularly great in this aspect.

However, she at least is not looking to end the (imperfect) system of democracy
that we have enjoyed for the past few centuries. At least we might be able to
reconsider her presidency in four years if we have someone else that's better.

## The Other People

I said there are two candidates running, and some other people as well. If you
ask a normal person to name anyone else running for president, the most likely
answer you'd get is "Joe Biden". The other people running for president offer a
chance to split the left's vote to make it easier for the right's candidate to
win.

People on the far-right are sticking to the one option they know they have, and
aren't talking about switching their vote because of a minor policy
disagreement. A vote given to a third party is a vote not given to the one that
has a chance of winning, and is effectively a vote given to the party you liked
the least. When the right's candidate wins by 0.5%, and a left-leaning third
party candidate only got 0.5%, it doesn't matter that most people didn't like
him - he won more votes.

Regardless of which side you're on in this race, the voters that matter aren't
even aware of there being other people running, so it's better for you to vote
for the one that actually has a possibility to win.

Yes, this system is terrible, but it's the system that we have. Any hope of
getting a better system dies with one of the possible winners.

The choice we're presented with is this: do we want another election in 2028, or
do we not?
