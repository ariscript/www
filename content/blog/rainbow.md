Today, Meta[^meta]
[removed the nonbinary and transgender themes from Facebook Messenger](https://www.404media.co/meta-deletes-trans-and-nonbinary-messenger-themes/).
They have their own explanation for this action, which you may be inclined to
believe, but perhaps you'd reconsider considering that they have also reportedly
[removed menstrual products from mens' restrooms](https://twitter.com/NewsWire_US/status/1877856693159092445),
an overtly transphobic move that discriminates against trans men. Meta's
moderation guidelines have also loosened on this matter to the point of allowing
hate speech _specifically_ towards LGBTQ+ people.

> Meta is now telling content moderators that statements like "A trans person
> isn't a he or she, it's an it," and “Trans people aren't real. They're
> mentally ill,” and “This whole nonbinary thing is made up. Those people don't
> exist, they're just in need of some therapy" no longer violate its rules[.]

Meta also ended their program of fact-checking posts. They're also
[censoring posts about their censorship](https://www.404media.co/facebook-is-censoring-404-media-stories-about-facebooks-censorship/)
on their platforms, which is straight out of authoritarian regimes or dystopian
books.

In May 2024, Target
[removed pride merchandise](https://apnews.com/article/target-lgbtq-pride-667ab2f6545645f5f86ca76394e531d6)
from some stores due a swarm of backlash from homophobic and transphobic
"activists".

Rainbow capitalism as a phenomenon existed because it was profitable for
corporations to pander to LGBTQ+ consumers, and give off an image of being
pro-rights. The truth doesn't actually matter in this context, maybe it's
pride-washing in the same sense of green-washing for climate action. The recent
backpedaling on this suggests that it's no longer in the profit interests of
large corporations to (or pretend to) support us.

I've never been a fan of rainbow capitalism, either before or after I realized
that I too am a target of this messaging. However, I saw the silver lining that
this is only a thing because the companies determined it's good for them. That's
just untrue in this current climate, and especially so considering that these
large companies need to stay in the favor of the upcoming US administration. As
much as I hate to be a downer, we're looking at the rotting corpse of the
canary; things will get worse before they get any better.

I no longer have an account on any Meta platform.

## Where do we go now?

In the last few years, we've seen platforms
[enshittify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) dramatically.
Twitter[^twitter] has gone completely down the drain, and this seems to be the
direction Zuckerberg wants to take Meta's platforms. What we need is something
that truly can never be "taken over" by hostile parties, or have a dictatorial
leader that has full control over the platform. We need to democratize social
media and connection.

[^meta]:
    I really wanted to add the [meta tag](/tags/meta) to this post, but it's
    reserved for posts about this website.

    Also, the _company_ is called Meta. This will make sense when you read the
    next footnote.

[^twitter]:
    I subscribe to [Hank Green's philosophy](https://youtu.be/NyV54qfSZwg) of
    place names, where the _company_ that runs the platform has been renamed to
    $\mathbb{X}$, but the _community_ itself is separate, and cannot be
    unilaterally renamed.
