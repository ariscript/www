## Testimonials

Here are some more testimonials from people that are too short for their own
individual posts:

> I chose to apply to and enroll at Northeastern after reading Matthias
> Felleisen's Developing Developers blog post. This was, hands down, the best
> decision I have ever made in my life. Thanks to Fundies, I have grown into a
> rigorous programmer. My love for the curriculum inspired me to TA the
> accelerated version of the class and later Compiler Design, which I believe to
> be its natural successor. However, I am concerned that it might be impacted by
> the curriculum change.
>
> Additionally, thanks to Northeastern's CS curriculum, I have acquired the
> skills to contribute effectively to science, both through the research I
> conducted at the school and during my co-ops at Roblox and Scale AI. I am
> currently on leave from school to work as a research scientist at Cursor. I
> firmly believe I would not have had the skills to perform at these jobs
> without the Fundies curriculum. I do not think it needs to be altered.
> Computer science is hard, and students need to struggle to truly understand
> it.
