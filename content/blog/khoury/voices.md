thoughts that you want posted here, please reach out to me through either email
or the Khoury Discord (you can find me by name on either platform).

## Testimonials

Here are some more testimonials from people that are too short for their own
individual posts:

> I chose to apply to and enroll at Northeastern after reading Matthias
> Felleisen's Developing Developers blog post. This was, hands down, the best
> decision I have ever made in my life. Thanks to Fundies, I have grown into a
> rigorous programmer. My love for the curriculum inspired me to TA the
> accelerated version of the class and later Compiler Design, which I believe to
> be its natural successor. However, I am concerned that it might be impacted by
> the curriculum change.
>
> Additionally, thanks to Northeastern's CS curriculum, I have acquired the
> skills to contribute effectively to science, both through the research I
> conducted at the school and during my co-ops at Roblox and Scale AI. I am
> currently on leave from school to work as a research scientist at Cursor. I
> firmly believe I would not have had the skills to perform at these jobs
> without the Fundies curriculum. I do not think it needs to be altered.
> Computer science is hard, and students need to struggle to truly understand
> it.
>
> -- [Federico Cassano](https://federico.codes), Research scientist @ Cursor, TA
> for compilers, Former NUCCDC Captain

> In my experience working on interdisciplinary projects, having the key CS
> knowledge to properly abstract my models, separate my code base, and use tools
> like the command line and Linux was extremely helpful as my coworkers didn’t
> have the same knowledge (either because they are from math/physics/engineering
> backgrounds where programming is more of a “get it done” than something that
> is reusable, or it’s something they never were exposed to). It helped me
> greatly, not only as my research project shifted dramatically. Additionally,
> lots of my work was so reusable I was able to use it across different research
> projects and used it to gain more opportunities. I was able to work well with
> physicists when I had no physics background because I was able to provide key
> CS skills.
>
> One of the biggest takeaways I had from Fundies was the need for reusability
> in code, and I have found that to be especially true in physics where similar
> systems can be reused over and over to allow for rapid experimentation,
> especially with limited resources.

> and Robotics.
