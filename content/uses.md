# Uses

This page contains the things I _voluntarily_ use currently, and will be updated
as they change. See [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) for other people's `/uses`
pages.

## Operating Systems

-   macOS, for most computer-y tasks
-   Windows, when I need it (mostly never)
-   NixOS, in the future --- replacing Windows
-   iOS, for mobile

## General Apps

-   [1Password](https://1password.com/) for password management
-   [Discord](https://discord.com/) for virtually all messaging
-   [GPG Tools](https://gpgtools.org/) for GPG signing/encryption
-   iWork: Apple's office suite (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote)
-   [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for notes
-   [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) for RSS
-   The macOS Calendar app
-   The macOS Mail app
-   [Spotify](https://spotify.com/) for music

Not an "app", but [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) to use LaTeX.

### macOS

Because Apple is Apple, things that ought to be part of the OS are not. These
are effectively
"[PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) for macOS"
that I've collected over the years.

-   [Ice](https://icemenubar.app/) for menu bar management, and hiding extra
    icons
-   [Raycast](https://raycast.com/) for an improved Spotlight search
-   [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/) for a _vastly_ improved screenshot experience
-   [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/) for extracting other archive
    types
-   [UnnaturalScrollWheels](https://github.com/ther0n/UnnaturalScrollWheels) to
    have sane scroll behavior on both touchpad and mouse

## Browser

I use [Firefox](https://firefox.com/) for almost all my browsing;
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com) is reserved for websites I'm forced to use
which don't work elsewhere. All my extensions are therefore only installed on
the former.

-   [1Password](https://1password.com/) for password autofill
-   [AdNauseam](https://adnauseam.io/) for ad and tracker blocking
-   [ClearURLs](https://docs.clearurls.xyz/) to remove tracking from URLs
-   [Consent-O-Matic](https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic) to
    automatically handle GDPR popups
-   [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) to save my eyes
-   [Multi-account Containers](https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers)
    to maintain different account sets (e.g., personal and school)
-   [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) for more tracker blocking
-   [Refined GitHub](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github) for
    various UI improvements to GitHub
-   [Return Youtube Dislike](https://returnyoutubedislike.com/) for exactly what
    the name suggests
-   [Shinigami Eyes](https://shinigami-eyes.github.io/) to identify transphobes
    (and allies!) at a glance
-   [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) to auto-skip irrelevant segments
    on YouTube videos
-   [Tabliss](https://tabliss.io/) for a beautiful new tab page
-   [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) for easy reverse image search

## Development

### Apps

-   [DrRacket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/index.html) for... Racket
-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for most development
-   [Emacs](https://emacs.org/) to replace the former when I figure it out
-   [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) terminal emulator

### Languages

-   [Elisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html), when I want
    to fight the editor

-   [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/)
-   [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/)
-   JavaScript
    -   [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/) (yes this is a separate
        language, but part of the ecosystem)
    -   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
-   POSIX Shell, for trivial scripting

### Software

-   [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) for dotfile management
-   [Fish](https://fishshell.com/), the best shell
